# House_Loan_Prediction

This data analysis project involves exploring and analyzing a dataset related to loan approval. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, consisting of both numerical and categorical variables. The goal is to build a predictive model for loan approval. Initial analysis includes examining the distribution of variables through univariate and bivariate analysis, identifying patterns and correlations. The project involves data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and outliers. Feature engineering is performed by creating new variables to enhance predictive capabilities. The primary machine learning model used is Logistic Regression, and its performance is assessed using accuracy scores in a cross-validated framework. Additionally, a Random Forest model is implemented and evaluated. The project aims to provide insights into factors influencing loan approval and to build accurate predictive models for future loan applications.
